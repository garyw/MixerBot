{HUTCH}
Every week we're going to be coming at you live with the latest in the world of Mixer developers

{MIKE}
But that's not all. Every week we'll bring new tutorials and samples to help you get the most out of Mixer and interactive

{HUTCH}
And we'll always be working in little secrets and pro tips directly from the developers to help you up your skills

{MIKE}
And all of you watching live will have the opportunity to help shape our show and our samples, plus ask questions directly to the Mixer team. You can also tweet at us with the hashtag #MixerDevShow to talk about content, tips, or samples that you'd like to see in the show.

{HUTCH}
And if you're a developer and you're adding interactive to your game, tool, or something completely different be sure to drop us a line and we might just feature you on the show!

{MIKE}
We have alot to cover today, starting with a brand new MixPlay original game: Halls of Horror!

{HUTCH}
After that we're going to finish up our overview of custom controls from last week by building a fun little game in a custom control.

{MIKE}
But before we get to that we want to know more about YOU! As we go into the next segment our awesome producer Tabz is going to pop up a poll where we've got a handful of questions to learn more about who's watching. It's multiple choice so just pick the option that you feel best represents you. If you don't see a great option for yourself then let us know in chat!

{HUTCH}
We're going to run this survey every week to understand who's out there, and use that to help pick better and more interesting samples for YOU, our favorite developers.

{MIKE}
With that, take it away with the news Hutch.

 - News: Halls of Horror

(Segment Header: Interactive News)

{HUTCH}
This week we wanted to highlight a brand new MixPlay Original released just in time for Halloween. 

(Roll HallsOfHorrorOverview)

Developers iFun4All created Halls of Horror, a multiplayer exploration game only on Mixer. In Halls of Horror, players are put into groups where they vote together on their character's actions with the only goal being to survive through a series of rooms set up by an insane Master of the Ceremony. 

{MIKE}
From a developer perspective, Halls of Horror shows off some interesting techniques. In addition to grouping players, players on different platforms can also take on different roles. Mobile players for example, can act as assistants for the killer as they make their way through the mansion. iFun4All also has a mixture of buttons that cost spark to celebrate the game at the end, as well as free actions used throughout the game to move the characters. Lastly, iFun4All leverages custom controls' ability to play local audio, which they may have used to give just you a little scare from time to time.

{HUTCH}
I also wanna mention iFun4All did a great job with their chatbot. We'll talk more about creating your own chatbot in a future episode, but take a look at the messages theirs sends to get an idea for how to teach the player and how to remind them of things every few minutes.

 - Custom Controls Overview Pt2

(Segment Header: Custom Controls Overview pt. 2)

{HUTCH}
Last week we gave a simple overview of what custom controls are, and how you can do things like include external sources and images inside of your custom control. We also talked about how you can approach debugging your control if these includes aren't working properly. This week we're going to provide a deeper overview of using some of the unique APIs available to custom controls.

{MIKE}
We're going to cover three high-level concepts as we build our game:

{HUTCH/MIKE riff on each}
	• Move video
	• Sending data from the custom control to the game client
	• Sending data from the game client to the custom control

{HUTCH}
We mentioned last week that custom controls use the same underlying protocol as interactive. But, custom controls also are able to fully leverage some extensions of the Mixer protocol to pass custom data up to your control running on a viewer's device. This allows you to display or act on more contextual information, to the point of building an experience that is deeply customized for every single viewer. 

{MIKE}
That's right, let's head on over to our developer site and take a look before we actually jump into building our game.
