A1 - Intro

{BRENNA}
Welcome to the Mixer Dev Show - the show where we jam out to the latest and greatest of developing for Mixer.

{GARY}
That's right! Whether you're a professional developer, hobby developer, or not a developer at all this is the show to learn about how you can build awesome integrations and tools into streams and games on Mixer. I'm Gary, in again for Hutch, and today I'm excited to have Brenna joining me.

{some off script about us or Hutch/Mike at Unite}

{BRENNA}
Every week we're going to be coming at you live with the latest in the world of Mixer developers

{GARY}
But that's not all. Every week we'll bring new tutorials and samples to help you get the most out of the Mixer platform

{BRENNA}
And we'll always be working in little secrets and pro tips directly from the developers to help you up your skills

{GARY}
And all of you watching live will have the opportunity to help shape our show and our samples, plus ask questions directly to the Mixer team. You can also tweet at us with the hashtag #MixerDevShow to talk about content, tips, or samples that you'd like to see in the show.

{BRENNA}
And if you're a developer and you're adding interactive to your game, tool, or something completely different be sure to drop us a line and we might just feature you on the show!

{GARY}
We've been hearing from a lot of you that you are interested in learning about chat bots, so today we're finally going to start building one.

{BRENNA}
But before that, we'll go over the basics of chat so that you'll understand the types of things a chat bot can do.

{GARY}
And I've been told you're going to show off a tool you built for streamers that lets them modify their view of chat while streaming.

{BRENNA}
That's right. And then we'll show an easy way to authenticate with Mixer, and then make a connection to chat and send and recieve chat messages.

{GARY}
But first we want to know more about YOU! As we go into the next segment our awesome producer Tabz is going to pop up a poll where we've got a handful of questions to learn more about who's watching. It's multiple choice so just pick the option that you feel best represents you. The questions show at the top of the chat window, so keep an eye out for them!

{BRENNA}
We run these surveys every week to understand who's out there, and use that to help pick better and more interesting samples for YOU, our favorite developers.

{GARY}
And with that, lets talk chat.

(Segment Header: Chat Basics)

{BRENNA}
Chat is how viewers can talk to the streamer on a channel. You can only send a message if you're signed in but you can also connect anonymously to chat and read messages.

{GARY}
When authenticated into a channel, you have roles within the channel. Some of these roles are things like User, a regular viewer, or Owner, the streamer. Some of these roles change the color of people's names in chat. For example, my name is yellow because I'm Mixer staff, and moderators have green names.

{BRENNA}
 (no script) what are mods and what can they do?

{GARY}
Another way to use chat without taling publicly is to send a whisper. This is a message from one user directly to another user in the same channel. No other users can see these messages.

{BRENNA}
A couple other things that you can do in chat that we're not going to show today are tagging other users and emotes. Tagging references another user in chat, gives a link to their profile and makes the message bold so that they notice it. Ane emotes are a way to provide an image in place of some of the message text.
